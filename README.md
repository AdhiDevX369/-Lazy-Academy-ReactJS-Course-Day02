# <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>

## <h2>Variables 📊</h2>

In JavaScript, there are three types of variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. `var` is an older way of declaring variables that is not used as much in modern JavaScript development. `let` and `const` are newer ways of declaring variables that are preferred because they provide better scoping and immutability, respectively.

## <h2>Value Types 📝</h2>

JavaScript has several value types that are used to represent different kinds of data. These include `string` 🔤, `number` 🔢, `boolean` 🚩, `undefined` 🆖, and `null` 🅾️.

## <h2>Static vs Dynamic Languages 📊💻</h2>

JavaScript is a dynamic language 💃, which means that data types are determined at runtime. Static languages, on the other hand, require data types to be declared at compile time. This can have implications for performance and code maintainability.

## <h2>Reference Types 🧐🔍</h2>

JavaScript also has several reference types, including `object` 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, `array` 📚, and `function` 🎛️. Reference types are used to represent more complex data structures.
